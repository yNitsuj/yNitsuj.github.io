		<h1>How is looking at something like the Earth from above a fantasy?</h1>

		<p id="question1">
			<div id="quote">The feeling of Earth's scale got exponentially smaller as new technologies were made that surveyed the world. </div> However just a few centuries ago, the closest thing to looking at the whole Earth at once was creating art and maps that represented the world such as the Great Globe in London. At that time, a structure like that only allowed visitors to imagine. Today, we have planetorians that simulates the universe to us.

		<h2>Do you agree or disagree? Both? Does it make you think of anything we have discussed in class previously? Does it bring up other themes from the reading? </h2>

		<p id="timeless">
			I definitely agree with this statement of thinking about the time periods. People in the past were limited with what was considered their fantasy of 'looking down on Earth'. It makes me think of when we talked about how Design works through history, either getting better and more advanced or some pieces just remaining timeless. In regards to viewing the Earth as a whole, nowadays, it's not that crazy to think about people going up to space and to see pictures of the Earth from their perspective while not that long ago, something lke that would be considered crazy and their 'fantasies' were more limited. On that same note, I feel that our idea of fantasy, including other subjects other than just viewing Earth, will also broaden with time.
