     "Now is the Time" is like someone motivating themself for a leap of faith. A person is depicted jumping into the a void of unknown. As that person jumps into the unknown, everything starts to become abstracted as they continue downwards. The construct of time starts to become nonexistent, askewing the linear perception of time. It becomes cyclic and linear at the same time. It warps time to the point where the person would end up where they just started. Is time linear? Is time cyclic? How can something so mundane be so unknown to us? Are we taking a leap of faith. a leap into the unknown, when we embrace time? Can time end? When time ends, do we end? Is the hole a representation of time? If so, is there a limit to time? How many <span id="time">times</span> can we jump through the hole until we stop?
